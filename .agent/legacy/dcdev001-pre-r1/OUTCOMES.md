# Project Outcome Ledger Template

After adoption, this append-only ledger records results for project directives. Every live outcome must reference one local directive ID.

## Entry schema after adoption

Use live outcome headings only after adoption. The following schema is instructional and is not a live entry:

Allowed adopted-project outcome states: `COMPLETE`, `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`, `SUPERSEDED`. Do not rewrite earlier entries; append corrections referencing the original.

## D-20260815-dcdev001a-architecture-selection - PARTIAL

- Outcome ID: OUT-DCDEV001A-ARCHITECTURE-SELECTION
- Supersedes outcome: none
- Closed: 2026-08-15T16:00:00-04:00
- Acceptance: PACKAGE_COMPLETE_PENDING_ARCHITECT_REVIEW
- Summary: Clean scientific base established, governance carry-forward classified, external source-level patterns compared, and one bounded hybrid architecture selected.
- Changed areas: governance reconciliation, developmental/sensorimotor strategy documentation, dcdev001 machine-readable artifacts.
- Validation:
  - Governance ADOPTED validator - PASSED
  - JSON parse and required-file manifest check - PASSED
  - chemistry-core d088 tests - 4 passed
  - phase1-certifier metrics_semantics - 4 passed
  - full workspace test - BLOCKED by pre-existing missing d008/stage_e_balance/attempt_003/result.json
  - Rust formatting check - BLOCKED by pre-existing clean-base formatting drift
- Remaining risks: independent architect review; full workspace fixture gap; future license recheck before reuse.
- Blockers: none for architecture selection; no implementation authorized.
- Follow-up directive: future local regulator implementation only after separate authorization.
