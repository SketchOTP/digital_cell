# Project Outcome Ledger Template

After adoption, this append-only ledger records results for project directives. Every live outcome must reference one local directive ID.

## Entry schema after adoption

Use live outcome headings only after adoption. The following schema is instructional and is not a live entry:

Allowed adopted-project outcome states: `COMPLETE`, `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`, `SUPERSEDED`. Do not rewrite earlier entries; append corrections referencing the original.

## D-20260815-dcdev001a-architecture-selection - PARTIAL

- Outcome ID: OUT-DCDEV001A-ARCHITECTURE-SELECTION
- Supersedes outcome: none
- Closed: 2026-08-15T16:00:00-04:00
- Acceptance: PARTIAL
- Summary: Clean scientific base established, governance carry-forward classified, external source-level patterns compared, and one bounded hybrid architecture selected; R1 remediation remains open.
- Changed areas: governance reconciliation, developmental/sensorimotor strategy documentation, dcdev001 machine-readable artifacts.
- Validation:
  - Governance ADOPTED validator - PASSED
  - JSON parse and required-file manifest check - PASSED
  - chemistry-core d088 tests - PASSED
  - phase1-certifier metrics_semantics - PASSED
  - full workspace test - BLOCKED by pre-existing missing d008/stage_e_balance/attempt_003/result.json
  - Rust formatting check - BLOCKED by pre-existing clean-base formatting drift
- Remaining risks: R1 exact-head workflow and architect review.
- Blockers: no implementation authorized.
- Follow-up directive: D-20260815-dcdev001a-r1

## D-20260815-dcdev001a-r1 - PARTIAL

- Outcome ID: OUT-DCDEV001A-R1
- Supersedes outcome: OUT-DCDEV001A-ARCHITECTURE-SELECTION
- Closed: 2026-08-15T07:04:51-04:00
- Acceptance: PARTIAL
- Summary: R1 package is prepared for exact-head validation; no scientific implementation has started.
- Changed areas: provenance manifests, first-slice contract, governed disposition records, source license record, current state, and scoped workflow.
- Validation:
  - JSON parse and contract-boundary checks - PASSED
  - governance ADOPTED validator - BLOCKED by active-ledger schema corrections in progress
  - remote exact-head workflow - NOT RUN
- Remaining risks: remote workflow identity/conclusion and architect re-review.
- Blockers: exact-head validation is not yet complete.
- Follow-up directive: none

## D-20260815-dcdev002-local-regulatory-substrate - PARTIAL

- Outcome ID: OUT-DCDEV002-LOCAL-REGULATORY-SUBSTRATE
- Supersedes outcome: none
- Closed: 2026-08-15T11:35:00-04:00
- Acceptance: PARTIAL
- Summary: Isolated `regulatory-core` substrate, frozen Gates -1 through 11, generated evidence, documentation, governance records, and scoped CI were completed from the exact DC-DEV-001A accepted head. The coder package is awaiting architect review.
- Changed areas: regulatory-core workspace crate, immutable material-frame adapter, DC-DEV-002 artifacts/docs/workflow, and current governance state.
- Validation:
  - Governance ADOPTED validator - PASSED
  - Regulatory-core focused suite - PASSED (12 tests)
  - Phase-1 metrics semantics - PASSED (4 tests)
  - D-088 focused regression - PASSED (4 tests)
  - Evolution-harness regression - PASSED (40 tests)
  - Exact-head GitHub Actions run 31892904994 on 8d8d637d157cd79ed4e6bf4fc8124e6ac3837275 - PASSED
  - Full workspace fixture path - NOT RUN (pre-existing D-008 fixture boundary)
- Remaining risks: architect inspection of the pushed PR and scientific interpretation of the bounded substrate.
- Blockers: architect exact-head review; DC-DEV-003 remains unauthorized.
- Follow-up directive: none

## D-20260815-dcdev003-regulatory-topology-continuity - PARTIAL

- Outcome ID: OUT-DCDEV003-REGULATORY-TOPOLOGY-CONTINUITY
- Supersedes outcome: none
- Closed: 2026-08-15T15:00:00-04:00
- Acceptance: PARTIAL
- Summary: The bounded observer-only continuity layer and live assay are implemented from the exact DC-DEV-002 accepted head; final pushed-head CI and architect review remain pending.
- Changed areas: regulatory-core continuity module and immutable continuity adapter, DC-DEV-003 assay/artifacts/docs/workflow, current governance state.
- Validation:
  - Regulatory-core continuity suite - PASSED (15 tests before final event-validation additions)
  - Live growth/remesh assay - PASSED locally (3 split remesh events, 24 to 48 to 72 to 96 vertices)
  - Regulator-on/off organism trajectory comparison - PASSED locally (serialized hashes equal)
  - Governance ADOPTED validation - PASSED
  - Phase-1 focused regression - PASSED (4 tests)
  - D-088 focused regression - PASSED (4 tests)
  - Evolution-harness regression - PASSED (40 tests)
  - Exact-head remote CI run 31913029009 on fafa642c97d85566c696aad61ac57fe777ac94c0 - PASSED
  - Full workspace fixture path - NOT RUN (pre-existing D-008 fixture boundary)
- Remaining risks: final CI may expose formatting or integration defects; architect must verify the mapping semantics and exact remote head.
- Blockers: exact-head remote CI and architect review.
- Follow-up directive: none

## D-20260815-dcdev004-energy-coupled-local-contractility - PARTIAL

- Outcome ID: OUT-DCDEV004-ENERGY-COUPLED-LOCAL-CONTRACTILITY
- Supersedes outcome: none
- Closed: 2026-08-15T19:17:08-04:00
- Acceptance: PARTIAL
- Summary: The first bounded local contractility implementation and local gate assay are complete from the accepted DC-DEV-003 head; final scoped remote CI and architect review remain pending.
- Changed areas: bounded chemistry-core edge-tension mechanics hook, regulatory-core contractility adapter, DC-DEV-004 assay/artifacts/docs/workflow, current governance state.
- Validation:
  - Regulatory-core suite - PASSED (18 tests)
  - DC-DEV-004 local gate assay - PASSED (Gates 0 through 7)
  - D-091 reserve R selected as existing funding resource; R to W expenditure observed
  - Zero-activity exact legacy parity - PASSED
  - Zero-resource no-actuation parity - PASSED
  - Local deformation and tensile closed-loop reduction - PASSED
  - Repeated-actuation metabolic limitation - PASSED
  - DC-DEV-003 remesh continuity compatibility - PASSED locally
  - Final preservation regressions and exact-head remote CI - PENDING
  - Architect review - PENDING
- Remaining risks: final CI must verify the exact pushed head and preservation boundaries; architect must inspect the physical interpretation and frozen resource conversion.
- Blockers: final exact-head validation and architect review.
- Follow-up directive: none
